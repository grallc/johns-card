# John's Card
Computational Thinking project: Credit Cards.  
The purpose of this project is to check whether if a credit card number is valid or not using the Luhn Algorithm.       
I therefore created a simple website for this.

## Run
1. `git clone https://github.com/grallc/johns-card`
2. Open `index.html`
3. `tada`
